# Under Construction
This is my website to host all of my notable personal projects.

## Development

This project is set up with React + Vite (JavaScript).

### Node version

This project targets Node 22 (LTS). An `.nvmrc` is included, so you can run `nvm use` to switch. The `engines` field in `package.json` requires Node >= 22.12.0.

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Start the local dev server
- `npm run build` – Produce a production build in `dist/`
- `npm run preview` – Preview the production build locally

### Quick start

1. Install dependencies
2. Start the dev server

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).
